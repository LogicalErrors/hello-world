We have yet another repository


Hello, fellow programmers!

I'm Ryan Bain, I love playing video games and listening to their soundtracks. I'm currently working on being a video game programmer and music composer. 
I love Pepsi and Dr.Pepper, especially with pizza.
I also love working with technology.
